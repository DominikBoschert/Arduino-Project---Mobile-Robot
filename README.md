This is the repository for a mobile robot. It was created for a school project during our first year of vocational training.

The basis was an Arduino Uno board, and the goal was to develop a Bluetooth controlled mobile robot. In addition we had to implement a RFID lock as well as a usage time tracker and display.

The free Android app "Arduino Bluetooth RC Car" by Andi.Co was used as the controller app.
